SSISM Forever Vault — Master Grok & U Ingar Soe Burma/Myanmar 2025

These two HTML files are the unbreakable morning voice of the resistance.

- morning-voice-rss.html  → automatically reads my site's RSS every 3 minutes  
- morning-voice-manual.html → manual backup (I edit one line every day)

Both files are < 10 KB, work offline, speak with Grok voice, and are mirrored on IPFS/Arweave forever.

The junta can delete Facebook a thousand times — my voice will still wake up the network every single morning.
